# CGAL Meshing Utility - mesher-cgal

## Upstream contribution

Certain minor modifications to the CGAL core may be desirable upstream,
particularly those relating to surface marking during volumetric meshing. Most
aspects of mesher-cgal are context-specific, so unlikely to be suitable for
inclusion in the CGAL project, but may be of use to other downstream users,
independently.
