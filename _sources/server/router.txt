Go-Smart Simulation Architecture - WAMP Router
==============================================

The simulation server and client relate to each other through a WAMP
server. For this purpose, we recommend
`Crossbar <http://crossbar.io/>`__ and have provided sample
configuration within the GSSA source tree (in the ``web/``
subdirectory).

This allows direct interaction between clients of various languages (JS,
Python and C# have been used) with the Python server.
