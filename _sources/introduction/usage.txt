Usage
=====

The simulation server may be launched by the command

.. code-block:: sh

  go-smart-simulation-server --host $WAMP_ROUTER \
    --websocket-port 8080 $CHOSEN_SERVER_NAME

This will register WAMP end-points onto the router at ``$WAMP_ROUTER`` via port ``8080``.
The ``$CHOSEN_SERVER_NAME`` is an identifier that allows persistence of Glossia data within
the current directory, so that existing simulation records will be available on restart. It
is also supplied to the WAMP router to enable server-specific commands to be issued.
