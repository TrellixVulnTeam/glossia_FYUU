Installation
============

In general, it is recommended to use Glossia within a Docker container.
See the `Quickstart <quickstart.rst>`_ documentation for this usage.
However, if you do want to install Glossia separately on a host, for
development or testing, these instructions apply. If you have difficulty
you may still find comparing with the Dockerfile useful, as it
comprises a verifiable list of instructions for Glossia installation
on an Ubuntu base.

Dependencies
------------

* Python 2.7
* Python 3
* `Elmer (with NUMA modifications) <https://github.com/go-smart/gssf-elmer>`_
* GMSH
* VTK 5.8
* libjsoncpp-dev
* (Python 3) munkres pyyaml
* (Python 2) PythonOCC

Building
--------

CMake installation is recommended from an out-of-source build directory.

.. code-block:: sh

  git clone https://github.io/go-smart/glossia.git
  mkdir glossia-build
  cd glossia-build
  cmake ../glossia-build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALLATION_TARGET
  make
  make install

The ``$INSTALLATION_TARGET`` may be ``~/.local`` for per-user testing or
the entire ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` argument may be omitted for system-wide
installation.
