# Documentation workflow

This documentation is created primarily using Markdown,
for simplicity, but using Sphinx. As such, `index.rst`
files are in reStructuredText, as are any docstrings.

To regenerate and upload a new documentation version:

```sh
cd docs/
make html
ghp-import -n _build/html
git push origin gh-pages
```

This should become visible at <https://go-smart.github.io/glossia>.
